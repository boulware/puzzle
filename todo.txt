1) Mess with sockets and get some basic netplay stuff going.
2) When unfocusing ui_elements in a container, if you don't access unfocus through the UI_Group, then the UI_Group.focused_container won't update properly
3) empty message in chat box glitches
4) hitting host multiple times glitch
5) disconnecting doesn't properly show that the connection has ended
6) Some kind of cascading input catching, so I can give certain inputs ('typable' input, ESC, return) to certain UI elements based on what is in focus, and then pass the 'unused' input down the chain to other elements.
